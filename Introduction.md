# What is Webscraping? 

- The process of extracting data from websites. 
- The task is carried out by a piece of code. 
- The code searches for the data you need and saves it to a file.

# The Process

- Find the URL that you want to scrape
- Inspect the page
- Find the data you want to extract
- Write the code
- Run the code and extract the data
- Store the data in the required format 

# Challenges

- All websites are structured differently 
- Custom code needs to be written for each site 
- Structure can change without warning
- Some sites deny access to scrapers

# Websites and HTML
